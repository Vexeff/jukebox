## Spotify Jukebox

This web app opens your Spotify library as a Jukebox, with jukebox functionality built in. \
Premium account required.

### Functionality
1. Playlist scrolling: Arrows at the left let you leaf through playlists. 
2. Song controls: Below the arrows, you can play/pause music, as well as go to next/previous track in the queue. 
3. Playlist selection: Enter playlist number as seen in the Jukebox (i.e. zero-padded if single-digit), followed by track number. Click 'OK' button to submit queue, and 'RESET' button to clear. 
4. Volume control: Volume knob on the right hand side.
5. Money for queueing songs: Click on coin slot button below the Jukebox screen.

### Functionality notes:
1. For now, only loads a maximum of 100 tracks in a playlist at a time.
2. Not optimized for small devices for aesthetic purposes.
